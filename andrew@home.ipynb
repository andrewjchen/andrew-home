    "This method is very error-prone and time intensive, the computational complexity of finding the relevant files is $O(n)$ on disk, the slowest storage on mondern computers, which is furthermore performed at a human's pace, making the process even slower."

    "There are alternatives, of course, for such an inefficient process. A user can decide to copy the entire contents of the disk. However, this process can only maintain the redundancy of a single machine-- backup and restore will only work if the entire contents of the backup are from the same machine. A user with an OSX and an Ubuntu machine will not be able to restore from the same medium, because the OSX disk data will be very different from the Ubuntu disk data. Backup of data in this format therefore scales according to $O(n)$, meaning that the data required to backup n machines is proportional to the number of machines requiring backup. Clearly, this is not optimal."

    "One such problem with a database for the relevant files is that this database requires syncing between the various machines the owner uses. For this reason, most backup software stores settings to the cloud in order to automatically update the lists. However, any sensible user with any concern for privacy will find issue with this policy. Not only is the backup service at the whim of a company service, which may shut down without notice, but also the lists of every file, and possibly the contents of sensitive files, are being exchanged on the internet.

    "The need for a file database stored in `$HOME` or on the cloud also lacks elegance. After all, the backup media contain a list of all the files that require backup... that's stored on a ubiquitous piece of software called a filesystem. In the simplest scheme, the backup folder is  *the* folder, that is exchanged freely between machines. However, the backup folder oftentimes will contain files that need to be in specific locations on local machines-- for example, \"dotfiles\" for unix machines. "
